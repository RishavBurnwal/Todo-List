Quick start
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/RishavBurnwal/Todo-List.git
   cd Todo-List
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   npm install react-icons
3. Run in development mode:
   npm run dev   # if using Vite
   npm start     # if using Create React App

Project structure (typical)
- public/ — static assets and index.html
- src/
  - components/ — React components (Todo.jsx, Header.jsx, Form.jsx, TodoList.jsx)
  - App.jsx — main app component
  - index.js — app entry point
  - Todo.css — main stylesheet
- assets/ — images and screenshots (optional)

Development notes
- Built with React functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Logic is modular: separate components for rendering and state updates
- Accessibility: inputs and buttons should have proper labels and aria-labels where needed
- Future enhancement: tasks can be persisted using localStorage

Customization
- Styling: edit CSS files (Todo.css) to change colors, spacing, and fonts
- Storage: replace or extend with API/localStorage for persistence
- State: integrate Redux, Zustand, or Context API for more complex state management
- Icons: replace or extend React Icons in components for a different look
